# React + PostgreSQL + Express App

This project is a full-stack web application built with React, PostgreSQL, and Express, designed to manage a database of cows and farmers. It includes a server-side API for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on both cow and farmer data, as well as user authentication with login and registration functionality.

## Features:

- **Server API**: Utilizes Express.js to create a RESTful API for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
- **CRUD Operations**: Allows users to perform CRUD operations on the cow and farmer data, including adding, editing, deleting, and retrieving records.
- **User Authentication**: Implements user authentication functionality with login and registration forms to securely manage access to the application.
- **Sorting and Export**: Provides sorting functionality to organize data and export options to generate JSON files for easy data management and analysis.

## Technologies Used:

- **React**: Frontend framework for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Express**: Backend framework for building the server and API endpoints.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system for storing and managing data.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for running server-side code.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework for responsive and mobile-first web development.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Used for secure authentication and authorization of users.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests from the frontend to the backend.
